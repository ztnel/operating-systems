The folders Part 1 and Part 2 contain the assignment solutions and discussion of results. Each folder has a separate Makefile which can be used to easily compile the solution and create the executable.

Running the Solutions
Both Part 1 and Part 2 are formatted the same so the execution instructions can be repeated for each part.

Compiling, Executing and Cleanup:
1. Open a linux terminal
2. Navigate to /Part\ [insert part number]
3. In the terminal type >> make all
	This will compile and create an executable file for all relevant files
4. Next type >> make run
	This will execute the executables created by the Makefile all command
5. For cleanup type >> make rm
	This will remove all the executable files made by Makefile all
